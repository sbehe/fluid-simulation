Parallelizing the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) fluid simulation was both exciting and challenging. Initially, the serial version was too slow, so I used OpenMP to parallelize the computationally expensive loops. Applying #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2), I distributed work across cores, but faced load imbalance, which I improved using dynamic scheduling. Data races in the streaming step caused incorrect results. False sharing also slowed things down, so I optimized memory alignment. Performance improved significantly, achieving around 6x speedup on 8 cores, but scaling wasnâ€™t ideal due to memory bandwidth limits and synchronization overhead.
